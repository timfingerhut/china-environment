># I. Sources and Methodology

> ## Media Selection
Newspapers are chosen as the source media for reports on environmental issues as they provide readers with in-depth and continuous flows of information and the authority in newspapers cannot be substituted by any other media. In particular, newspapers can provide a historical perspective on public opinion that may not be otherwise possible. 

>Our mainland sources include China Daily, Shanghai Daily, Global Times, and People’s Daily, and, our Hong-Kong-based source is South China Morning Post. 

>China Daily is a so-called "state-run" newspaper of which editorial policies are slightly more liberal than other most Chinese newspapers. It serves those who are foreigners in China and those who wish to improve their English. Shanghai Daily, the largest English-language newspaper in East China, serves an audience who are expats living in Shanghai, foreign investors and Shanghai white-collar workers who are fluent in English. People's Daily, also the biggest newspaper group in China, is an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. It is commonly considered to provide direct information on points of view of the Party and its policies. Global Times, an English newspaper under people's Daily, considers itself to be the only English newspaper that conveys to foreign countires comprehensive news which conform with fundamental realities of China. Last but not least, South China Morning Post, before being acquired by a Chinese mainland group called Alibaba in 2016, had been owned by Europeans for long and provide a fairly dependent perspective towards Chinese central government policies. We extracted data from different newspapers to find similarities and divergences in terms of their way to frame environmental issues in China.

> ## Methodology
>In order to analyze and compare discourse on climate change in Chinese media, we used Factiva database in order to collect over 16,000 articles from January of 2017 to October of 2017. In order to reduce noise and target our research to analyzing how climate change has been discussed in environmental context, we limited the scope of articles based on their ‘Subjects’ on Factiva. As described below, we narrowed the article subjects down to, for example, ‘Air/Water/Land Quality’ and ‘Natural Environment’. In analyzing the corpa consisting of these articles, we have used digital methods through the [Cortext](http://www.cortext.net) platform, including demography analysis, network mapping, topic modeling, and contingency matrix.
