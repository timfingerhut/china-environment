| 100,000 copies                                |31 million web visits, 200,000 copies in circulation|
| “Pig carcass furore still raising worries”    |“Water safe despite carcasses"|
| Reason for carcasses not clear                |Shanghai authorities guaranteed the quality of drinking water|
| Government lacked explanation-suspicious!     |Dead pigs were removed, polluted stream did not affect water |
| Government’s publicity campaign               |Reason uncertain, but pigs were  young and  died of a virus|
