> # II. Media Coverage and Chinese Government: can Chinese Media Help the Government Clean the Air?

> ## A. Methodology 

> Our analysis strategy of the correlation between media and Chinese government first falls into a class of text analysis methods broadly characterized as co-occurence approaches ([M. Callon et al.](https://link-springer-com-s.acces-distant.sciences-po.fr/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02019280.pdf)), which produce categories by relying on terms' joint appearance over a particular unit of text ([Jean-Philippe Cointet et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/35/10837)). Given the way how clusters are connected with each other, our strategy then falls into a demography analysis. We extracted a [Term List](https://docs.cortext.net/corpus-terms-indexer/) from our corpus and then ran Cortext's [Demography Analysis](https://docs.cortext.net/demography/) script to grasp how major issues have evolved since 2000.

> This is a network mapping of our entire corpus. Node position is determined by a force vector algorithm ([Joacomy et al., forthcoming](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/publications/Jacomy_Heymann_Venturini-Force_Atlas2.pdf)) bringing together terms directly or indirectly linked, and keeping away terms with fewer cooccurrences. Node size is proportional to their frequency in the corpus. Node color follows the clusters identified by the clustering algorithm.

> We observed that "air pollution" is at the center of this map and more or less connected with all the other clusters. It is easy to understand because during the past 15 years, "Smog" is an ubiquitous political, social, economical and environmental topic with huge consequences for public health (See the picture below of a Chinese city).

> It is then natural to raise the following question: does media coverage foster government's policies against air pollution? We will focus on the topic of "air pollution" and check whether media has a proactive or reactive role towards the government.

> Four peaks are identified while three of them are more salient. They date back to:
> January 2013,
> December 2013,

> ### News Coverage
 
> 2013.01: Exceptionally high levels of particulate matter (PM) concentrations were reported for the area around Beijing (40 N, 116 E) with maximum concentrations exceeding 500 μg/m3.

> 2013.12: The 2013 Eastern China smog was a severe air pollution episode that affected East China, including all or parts of the municipalities of Shanghai and Tianjin, and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang, during December 2013.

> 2015.12: Beijing issued red alerts for severe pollution—the first since the emergency alert system was established. The municipal government closed schools, limited road traffic, halted outdoor construction, and paused factory manufacturing. 

> ### Government's Reaction

> 2013.09: China’s State Council released its Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control (Action Plan) on 12 September 2013 , eight months after the widely-reported air pollution episode that occurred in the January 2013, which covered one-sixth of China’s territory. 

> 2014.01: China’s new Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law came into effect.

> 2015.12: the Asian Development Bank approved a $300 million loan to help China address the capital region’s choking smog.

> ### Relevance of "Local Government" in "Air Pollution" Media Coverage

> ![network map]({{ site.url }}/china-environment/assets/images/Dempgraphy2peilin.png)

> “Local government” is more frequently mentioned than “central government” in air pollution reports due to provincial-level ignorance of edicts launched by the central government.

> In response to this ignorance at provincial level, China’s new Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law — also called the New Air Law came into full effect on January 1st. The New Air Law shifts how China prioritises air quality management, requiring cities to regularly release and submit definitive plans to ensure they are on track to meet national air quality targets.

> Local governments will be held accountable to make concrete plans to meet air quality targets and execute them accordingly. The New Law requires cities that fail to meet air quality standards to submit and publish detailed, explicit plans to achieve air quality targets. If air quality targets are not met after a certain period, local government leaders will be asked to explain and develop correction plans, and new projects in the city will be prohibited from undergoing required Environmental Impact Assessments.
