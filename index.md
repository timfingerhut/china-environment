> # Environmental Cost of China's Growth
> ## Overview 

> Our project assesses the evolution of discourse regarding environmental issues and climate change in the Chinese media from 2000 to 2017. Chinese news sources have continued to raise awareness of domestic environmental problems, such as air and water pollution, resulting from rapid industrialization and increased use of energy sources, particularly coal. Despite China’s increased carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, the discussion of climate change in media has been confined to an international, rather than a domestic context. 

> ## Background 

> China’s environmental problems [emerged](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-environmental-crisis) largely due to its policies promoting economic development and industrialization since the late 1970s. In order to achieve rapid growth, the Chinese government implemented reforms that encouraged the proliferation of rural industries and enterprises. In [sustaining](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799473/) an average growth rate at 9% over the past two decades, China has been able to lift millions out of poverty. 

> Its success, however, has come at a cost, as the local governments have been facing challenges in monitoring environmental standards. Over the years, industrial overuse and contamination have resulted in the rising levels of air, water, and soil pollution. In 2008, 20.8% of the 409 monitored sections across 200 rivers were [discovered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799473/) to have the lowest grade and no functional use. In 2005, 11% out of 522 cities were [considered](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es072643l) to have heavy air pollution rates, while 56% met the environmental protection standards. The degradation of air quality [was attributed to](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPREGTOPENVIRONMENT/Resources/China_Cost_of_Pollution.pdf) high levels of coal consumption, which had increased by 75% the same year. Less than a decade later, China had become the largest source of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to 27% on a global scale. 

> Environmental degradation has contributed to deteriorating health standards, and raised concerns among the Chinese public. [According to](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/tackling-chinas-environmental-health-crisis) a 2007 World Bank study revealed that health costs resulting from air and water pollution totaled 4% of the country’s GDP. Moreover, in 2012 dangerous PM 2.5 particulate pollutants were correlated with over 650,000 premature deaths resulting from cancer, stroke, and pulmonary diseases. As air pollution has continued to deteriorate, it has reduced life expectancy by five years in the northern regions of China. Due to the prevalence of toxic chemicals that have affected water and soil, over four hundred ‘cancer villages’ have emerged across the country. 

>In response, the government [has been reporting](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-environmental-crisis) an increasing number of ‘abrupt environmental’ and ‘mass’ incidents and protests. In 2013, there were 712 such incidents resulting from ongoing environmental issues. Moreover, Internet and social media have enabled the Chinese people to learn about and spread information regarding air and water pollution, and land deterioration, as the protests have started to shift from rural to urban areas. In addition, documentaries, such as Under the Dome (2015) that revealed the levels of China’s air pollution, attracted thousands of viewers before being censored, and caused an outrage in the country.

> ## Government's Response
> The Chinese government has drawn up initiatives [to combat](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-environmental-crisis) ongoing environmental issues. In 2013, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, revealed its plan to tackle climate change by 2020, while requiring factories to report on figures regarding their discharges. It further allocated $600 billion to improve air and water quality, and started investing in renewable energy. In 2015, China joined the Paris Climate accord, and started to cap the number of cars powered by fossil fuels. During the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2017, President Xi Jinping repeatedly [mentioned](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/27/news/economy/china-crackdown-pollution-economy/index.html) the terms ‘environment’ and ‘green’, which, according to Tommy Xie, an economist at the OCBC Bank, reveals a shift in mentality of the Chinese leadership. 

> ## Research Question: Chinese Media and the Discussion of Climate Change 
> Despite its attempts to resolve environmental issues and its participation in global dialogue, the Chinese government’s position on climate change has remained contentious. As the country is the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, our research focuses on analyzing how the government-controlled press has been discussing climate change in relation to domestic environmental problems. Moreover, China has been ranked as 176 out of 180 countries based on the freedom of press, as the government [has censored](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china) media sources in order to retain authoritative control, while monitoring and blocking websites, including Wikipedia, Facebook, and Google. In using digital methods to [analyze](page6.md) over 16,000 Chinese press articles since 2000, our research has found that while the government-controlled press has been discussing air pollution in a local context, ‘climate change’ has been largely considered as an international, rather than a domestic issue.
